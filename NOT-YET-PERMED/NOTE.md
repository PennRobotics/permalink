These music snippets might illustrate how a [_bar repeat_](https://www.htmlsymbols.xyz/musical-symbols/figure-repetitions) (ùÑé) symbol could be helpful in ABC files as well as digits for counting the number of bars. As a confounding (or perhaps complementary) factor, trombone positions can be suggested by marking notes with 1 to 7 (with some exceptions for bass trombone, trigger-enabled positions, and slight microtonal adjustments needed for pitches outside of the normal range or to create consonance with a specific chord and tuning).

If that whole statement above is confusing: It would be nice for ABC to have the standard symbol to repeat the last bar. It would be nice to let someone easily put a number above/below this symbol as well as above/below any random note (using a standard font and without changing the measure spacing, as lyrics would do). This would make it easy to count repetitive sections and to mark trombone positions.
